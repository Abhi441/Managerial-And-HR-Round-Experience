////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////General Managerial Round Interview Question


Great question, Abhishek! 🙌 For a Tech Managerial round with 4 years of experience as a Full Stack .NET Developer (Angular + .NET Core + SQL Server), you can expect a mix of technical depth, architecture thinking, real-world problem-solving, and project ownership type questions.


---

🔹 1. Project Ownership & Role

> Q1. Tell me about your recent full stack project — your role, architecture, and technologies used.
Q2. What challenges did you face in that project and how did you resolve them?
Q3. How do you ensure clean code and maintainability in a full-stack project?




---

🔹 2. Backend (.NET Core/API) Questions

> Q4. How do you structure a real-world .NET Core application (Layers, DI, Configs)?
Q5. What are IRepository, Service, and Controller responsibilities?
Q6. How do you implement async/await in your repository pattern?
Q7. How do you handle exceptions globally in .NET Core?
Q8. Explain Middleware, Filters, and Logging — where would you use each?




---

🔹 3. Frontend (Angular) Questions

> Q9. How do you manage state and service communication in Angular?
Q10. Explain lifecycle hooks — where have you used ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy, etc.?
Q11. How do you secure an Angular app and handle route guards?
Q12. How does Angular consume REST APIs? How do you handle errors?




---

🔹 4. Database + SQL Server

> Q13. How do you write optimized SQL queries?
Q14. Difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, UNION, UNION ALL with real examples.
Q15. How do you call a stored procedure in ADO.NET?
Q16. Have you ever worked on query tuning/indexing?




---

🔹 5. System Design / Architecture

> Q17. If 1 million users access your app, how will your backend handle it?
Q18. How will you design a secure login system with Angular + .NET Core?
Q19. How do you decide when to use stored procedures vs. business logic in code?




---

🔹 6. Best Practices / DevOps / Testing

> Q20. How do you write unit tests for controllers and services?
Q21. What is CI/CD? Have you worked with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps?
Q22. What is SOLID principle — give a simple example.




---

🔹 7. Behavioral / Situational Questions

> Q23. How do you handle last-minute production bugs?
Q24. Tell me about a time when your deployment failed.
Q25. How do you mentor junior developers or help teammates?




---

✅ Bonus Tip:

> They will not just check your tech skills, but also:



Ownership of delivery

Thought process & estimation


Ability to explain clearly

Balance between frontend, backend, and DB






/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 "Can you explain the architecture of your project?"

👇 Interview-Ready Answer (Clean, Easy, Confident):

> "Sure! I built a Buy & Sell Property platform using a clean architecture that separates each responsibility — making the app more maintainable, testable, and scalable.




---

🏗️ Full Stack Architecture (Simplified Explanation)

🔹 1. Frontend (Angular)

> I used Angular to build a responsive UI where users can view property listings, check details, and filter/search properties.

Used Angular Services to call Web APIs.

Used @Input & @Output decorators for component communication.

HTTP Client (GET, POST, etc.) + Error handling via Interceptors.




🔹 2. Backend (.NET Core / .NET 8 Web API)

> I created RESTful APIs in .NET Core.

Used a layered structure:




Controller – Handles incoming HTTP requests.

Service Layer – Contains business logic.

Repository Layer – Interacts with SQL DB using ADO.NET.

Used Dependency Injection to keep things loosely coupled.


// Flow: Controller → Service → Repository → DB

🔹 3. Database Layer (SQL Server + ADO.NET)

> Used ADO.NET with parameterized queries to connect and fetch data.

Stored all property info in SQL tables.

Avoided ORMs to keep it lightweight and fully hands-on.




🔹 4. Extra Best Practices

> Used IRepository and IService interfaces for abstraction and testability.

Applied async/await for performance and scalability.

Used appsettings.json for DB connection and configurations.





---

🧠 Real-Time Example (Flow)

> "When a user opens the Property page in Angular, it sends an HTTP GET request to the backend API (e.g., /api/property).
The controller calls the service, which then calls the repository, fetches data from SQL, and sends it back to the Angular frontend — which displays it to the user."




---

🔐 Optional Add-Ons (If asked further)

Used Routing Guards in Angular for protecting routes (like Admin panel).

Handled global errors in .NET with UseExceptionHandler.

Prepared for future features like Payment Gateway or Notifications.
